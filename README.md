# Old Personal Website
This is my old and initial webpage for my personal website. I decided to discontinue using this webpage, because I was not satisfy with the outcome.

I developed the webpage using HTML5 and CSS3 with JavaScript and a few jQuery scripts. I also used the Bootstrap 3 framework.

If you would like to use this as your own personal website, you are welcome to use it as long as you give credit.
